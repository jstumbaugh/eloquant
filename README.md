## Usage

### Client Instantiation

Eloquant uses Basic HTTP Authentication for retrieving data from Eloqua. You
need to supply the username, site/company name, and password when initializing
the client.

```ruby
Eloquant::Client.new(username: "username", sitename: "mycompany", password: "password")
```

Alternatively, you can store these variables in your environment file:

```
ELOQUA_USERNAME='username'
ELOQUA_SITENAME='mycompany'
ELOQUA_PASSWORD='password'
```

### [Bulk API](https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/marketingcs_gs/OMCAB/Developers/BulkAPI/bulk-API.htm)

The Bulk API works a little differently than the REST API. [This post](https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/marketingcs_gs/OMCAB/Developers/BulkAPI/Tutorials/Export.htm)
does a fantastic job of explaining it.

First, it works by creating an "export" in Eloqua given a set of parameters.
The parameters are as follows:

- `name` (required) - The name of your export
- `fields` (required) - A hash containing the field mappings from a custom name to an Eloqua attribute
  - Ex:
```ruby
fields = {
  # Custom Name       => "Name in Eloqua"
  :contact_id         => "{{Contact.Id}}",
  :contact_first_name => "{{Contact.FirstName}}",
  :contact_last_name  => "{{Contact.LastName}}",
  :contact_created_at => "{{Contact.CreatedAt}}",
}
```
- `filter` (optional for most, required for Activities) - The [filters](https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/marketingcs_gs/OMCAB/Developers/BulkAPI/Tutorials/Filtering.htm?cshid=BulkFiltering) are used to narrow down your result
  - Ex: Activities require a filter based on the Activity Type.
```ruby
# All Web Visit Activities
filter = "'{{Activity.Type}}' = 'WebVisit'"
# All Email Send Activities after Jan 1, 2018
filter = "'{{Activity.Type}}' = 'EmailSend' AND '{{Activity.CreatedAt}}' >= '2018-01-01'"
```

Each of the Bulk API endpoints take these three named parameters.

After creating a bulk export, the URI of the sync from Eloqua is returned. You
can use this URI to query for the data.

```ruby
# Example 1: Get all of the Form Submit activities in a given time frame
client.create_bulk_activity_export(
  name: "Eloquant Bulk Activity Export Example",
  filter: "'{{Activity.Type}}' = 'FormSubmit'",
  fields: {
    id:            "{{Activity.Id}}",
    activity_date: "{{Activity.CreatedAt}}",
    contact_id:    "{{Activity.Contact.Id}}",
  },
)
#=> "/syncs/2010234"
sync_uri = "/syncs/2010234"

client.get_export_data(sync_uri)
#=> {
#    :totalResults => 49997,
#    :limit        => 1000,
#    :offset       => 0,
#    :count        => 1000,
#    :hasMore      => true,
#    :items        => [
#      {
#        :id            => "1",
#        :activity_date => "2018-11-02 13:25:26.203",
#        :contact_id    => "438294"
#      },
#      {
#        :id            => "2",
#        :activity_date => "2018-11-02 13:25:26.203",
#        :contact_id    => "982340"
#      },
#      ...
#    ]
#  }

# To get the next 1,000 results
client.get_export_data(sync_uri, offset: 1000)
#=> {
#    :totalResults => 49997,
#    :limit        => 1000,
#    :offset       => 1000,
#    :count        => 1000,
#    :hasMore      => true,
#    :items        => [
#      {
#        :id            => "1001",
#        :activity_date => "2018-11-02 1:22:34.213",
#        :contact_id    => "138573"
#      },
#      {
#        :id            => "1002",
#        :activity_date => "2018-11-02 15.24.12.323",
#        :contact_id    => "943209"
#      },
#      ...
#    ]
#  }

# To get the last of the results. Note the `count` and `hasMore` keys in response
client.get_export_data(sync_uri, offset: 49000)
#=> {
#    :totalResults => 49997,
#    :limit        => 1000,
#    :offset       => 49000,
#    :count        => 997,
#    :hasMore      => false,
#    :items        => [
#      ...
#      {
#        :id            => "49996",
#        :activity_date => "2018-11-02 13:25:26.203",
#        :contact_id    => "123456"
#      },
#      {
#        :id            => "49997",
#        :activity_date => "2018-11-02 13:25:26.203",
#        :contact_id    => "098439"
#      }
#    ]
#  }
```
- `totalResults` shows how many items in the database matched your query
- `limit` shows the number of items this response is limited to return
- `offset` shows the offset in which items in the query are paged through
  - An offset of 0 would return results 1 - 1,000. An offset of 1,000 would
    return results 1,001 - 2000
- `count` shows the number of items returned in this response
- `hasMore` is a boolean denoting if there are more results to page through
