## Usage

### Client Instantiation

Eloquant uses Basic HTTP Authentication for retrieving data from Eloqua. You
need to supply the username, site/company name, and password when initializing
the client.

```ruby
Eloquant::Client.new(username: "username", sitename: "mycompany", password: "password")
```

Alternatively, you can store these variables in your environment file:

```
ELOQUA_USERNAME='username'
ELOQUA_SITENAME='mycompany'
ELOQUA_PASSWORD='password'
```
